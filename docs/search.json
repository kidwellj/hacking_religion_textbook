The upside of this is that other researchers can learn from your work, correct and build on it as part of the commons. It takes a bit more time to learn and set things up, but the upside is that you’ll gain access to a set of tools and a research philosophy which is much more powerful."

    "text": "1.5 Learning to code: my way\nThis guide is a little different from other textbooks targetting learning to code. I remember when I was first starting out, I went through a fair few guides, and they all tended to spend about 200 pages on various theoretical bits, how you form an integer, or data structures, subroutines, or whatever, such that it was weeks before I got to actually do anything. I know some people, may prefer this approach, but I dramatically prefer a problem-focussed approach to learning. Give me something that is broken, or a problem to solve, which engages the things I want to figure out and the motivation for learning just comes much more naturally. And we know from research in cognitive science that these kinds of problem-focussed approaches can tend to faciliate faster learning and better retention, so it’s not just my personal preference, but also justified! It will be helpful for you to be aware of this approach when you get into the book as it explains some of the editorial choices I’ve made and the way I’ve structured things. Each chapter focusses on a problem which is particularly salient for the use of data science to conduct research into religion. That problem will be my focal point, guiding choices of specific aspects of programming to introduce to you as we work our way around that data set and some of the crucial questions that arise in terms of how we handle it. If you find this approach unsatisfying, luckily there are a number of really terrific guides which lay things out slowly and methodically and I will explicitly signpost some of these along the way so that you can do a “deep dive” when you feel like it. Otherwise, I’ll take an accelerated approach to this introduction to data science in R. I expect that you will identify adjacent resources and perhaps even come up with your own creative approaches along the way, which incidentally is how real data science tends to work in practice.\nThere are a range of terrific textbooks out there which cover all these elements in greater depth and more slowly. In particular, I’d recommend that many readers will want to check out Hadley Wickham’s “R For Data Science” book. I’ll include marginal notes in this guide pointing to sections of that book, and a few others which unpack the basic mechanics of R in more detail."

    "section": "1.6 Getting set up",
    "text": "1.6 Getting set up\nEvery single tool, programming language and data set we refer to in this book is free and open source. These tools have been produced by professionals and volunteers who are passionate about data science and research and want to share it with the world, and in order to do this (and following the “hacker way”) they’ve made these tools freely available. This also means that you aren’t restricted to a specific proprietary, expensive, or unavailable piece of software to do this work. I’ll make a few opinionated recommendations here based on my own preferences and experience, but it’s really up to your own style and approach. In fact, given that this is an open source textbook, you can even propose additions to this chapter explaining other tools you’ve found that you want to share with others.\nThere are, right now, primarily two languages that statisticians and data scientists use for this kind of programmatic data science: python and R. Each language has its merits and I won’t rehash the debates between various factions. For this book, we’ll be using the R language. This is, in part, because the R user community and libraries tend to scale a bit better for the work that I’m commending in this book. However, it’s entirely possible that one could use python for all these exercises, and perhaps in the future we’ll have volume two of this book outlining python approaches to the same operations.\nBearing this in mind, the first step you’ll need to take is to download and install R. You can find instructions and install packages for a wide range of hardware on the The Comprehensive R Archive Network (or “CRAN”): https://cran.rstudio.com. Once you’ve installed R, you’ve got some choices to make about the kind of programming environment you’d like to use. You can just use a plain text editor like textedit to write your code and then execute your programs using the R software you’ve just installed. However, most users, myself included, tend to use an integrated development environment (or “IDE”). This is usually another software package with a guided user interface and some visual elements that make it faster to write and test your code. Some IDE packages, will have built-in reference tools so you can look up options for libraries you use in your code, they will allow you to visualise the results of your code execution, and perhaps most important of all, will enable you to execute your programs line by line so you can spot errors more quickly (we call this “debugging”). The two most popular IDE platforms for R coding at the time of writing this textbook are RStudio and Visual Studio. You should download and try out both and stick with your favourite, as the differences are largely aesthetic. I use a combination of RStudio and an enhanced plain text editor Sublime Text for my coding.\nOnce you have R and your pick of an IDE, you are ready to go! Proceed to the next chapter and we’ll dive right in and get started!"

Because R is what is called an object-oriented programming language, we’ll always take our information and give it a home inside a named object. There are many different kinds of objects, which you can specify, but usually R will assign a type that seems to fit best.\nIf you’d like to explore this all in a bit more depth, you can find a very helpful summary in R for Data Science, chapter 8, “data import”.\nIn the example below, we’re going to read in data from a comma separated value file (“csv”) which has rows of information on separate lines in a text file with each column separated by a comma. This is one of the standard plain text file formats. R has a function you can use to import this efficiently called “read.csv”. Each line of code in R usually starts with the object, and then follows with instructions on what we’re going to put inside it, where that comes from, and how to format it:\n\nsetwd(\"/Users/kidwellj/gits/hacking_religion_textbook/hacking_religion\")\nlibrary(here) # much better way to manage working paths in R across multiple instances\n\nhere() starts at /Users/kidwellj/gits/hacking_religion_textbook\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n-- Attaching core tidyverse packages ------------------------ tidyverse 2.0.0 --\nv dplyr     1.1.3     v readr     2.1.4\nv forcats   1.0.0     v stringr   1.5.0\nv ggplot2   3.4.3     v tibble    3.2.1\nv lubridate 1.9.3     v tidyr     1.3.0\nv purrr     1.0.2     \n\n\n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\ni Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nhere::i_am(\"chapter_1.qmd\")\n\nhere() starts at /Users/kidwellj/gits/hacking_religion_textbook/hacking_religion\n\nuk_census_2021_religion &lt;- read.csv(here(\"example_data\", \"census2021-ts030-rgn.csv\"))"

We can choose a specific range of columns using select, like this:\nYou can use the filter command to do this.

    "text": "2.4 Making your first data visulation: the humble bar chart\nWe’ve got a nice lean set of data, so now it’s time to visualise this. We’ll start by making a pie chart:\n\nuk_census_2021_religion_wmids &lt;- uk_census_2021_religion_wmids %&gt;% select(no_religion:no_response)\nuk_census_2021_religion_wmids &lt;- gather(uk_census_2021_religion_wmids)\n\nThere are two basic ways to do visualisations in R. You can work with basic functions in R, often called “base R” or you can work with an alternative library called ggplot:\n\n2.4.1 Base R\n\ndf &lt;- uk_census_2021_religion_wmids[order(uk_census_2021_religion_wmids$value,decreasing = TRUE),]\nbarplot(height=df$value, names=df$key)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 GGPlot\n\nggplot(uk_census_2021_religion_wmids, aes(x = key, y = value)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n\n\n2\n\nWe’ll re-order the column by size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2ggplot(uk_census_2021_religion_wmids, aes(x= reorder(key,-value),value)) + geom_bar(stat =\"identity\")\n\n\n\n\nLet’s assume we’re working with a data set that doesn’t include a “totals” column and that we might want to get sums for each column. This is pretty easy to do in R:\n\n1uk_census_2021_religion_totals &lt;- uk_census_2021_religion %&gt;% select(no_religion:no_response)\nuk_census_2021_religion_totals &lt;- uk_census_2021_religion_totals %&gt;%\n2   summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(., na.rm = TRUE)))\n3uk_census_2021_religion_totals &lt;- gather(uk_census_2021_religion_totals)\n4ggplot(uk_census_2021_religion_totals, aes(x= reorder(key,-value),value)) + geom_bar(stat =\"identity\")\n\n\n1\n\nFirst, remove the column with region names and the totals for the regions as we want just integer data.\n\n2\n\nSecond calculate the totals. In this example we use the tidyverse library dplyr(), but you can also do this using base R with colsums() like this: uk_census_2021_religion_totals &lt;- colSums(uk_census_2021_religion_totals, na.rm = TRUE). The downside with base R is that you’ll also need to convert the result into a dataframe for ggplot like this: uk_census_2021_religion_totals &lt;- as.data.frame(uk_census_2021_religion_totals)\n\n3\n\nIn order to visualise this data using ggplot, we need to shift this data from wide to long format. This is a quick job using gather()\n\n4\n\nNow plot it out and have a look!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might have noticed that these two dataframes give us somewhat different results. But with data science, it’s much more interesting to compare these two side-by-side in a visualisation. We can join these two dataframes and plot the bars side by side using bind() - which can be done by columns with cbind() and rows using rbind():\n\nuk_census_2021_religion_merged &lt;- rbind(uk_census_2021_religion_totals, uk_census_2021_religion_wmids)\n\nDo you notice there’s going to be a problem here? How can we tell one set from the other? We need to add in something idenfiable first! This isn’t too hard to do as we can simply create a new column for each with identifiable information before we bind them:\n\nuk_census_2021_religion_totals$dataset &lt;- c(\"totals\")\nuk_census_2021_religion_wmids$dataset &lt;- c(\"wmids\")\nuk_census_2021_religion_merged &lt;- rbind(uk_census_2021_religion_totals, uk_census_2021_religion_wmids)\n\nNow we’re ready to plot out our data as a grouped barplot:\n\nggplot(uk_census_2021_religion_merged, aes(fill=dataset, x= reorder(key,-value), value)) + geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat =\"identity\")\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking closely, you will notice that I’ve added two elements to our previous ggplot. I’ve asked ggplot to fill in the columns with reference to the dataset column we’ve just created. Then I’ve also asked ggplot to alter the position=\"dodge\" which places bars side by side rather than stacked on top of one another. You can give it a try without this instruction to see how this works. We will use stacked bars in a later chapter, so remember this feature.\nIf you inspect our chart, you can see that we’re getting closer, but it’s not really that helpful to compare the totals. What we need to do is get percentages that can be compared side by side. This is easy to do using another dplyr feature mutate:\n\nuk_census_2021_religion_totals &lt;- uk_census_2021_religion_totals %&gt;% \n  dplyr::mutate(perc = scales::percent(value / sum(value), accuracy = 0.1, trim = FALSE))\nuk_census_2021_religion_wmids &lt;- uk_census_2021_religion_wmids %&gt;% \n  dplyr::mutate(perc = scales::percent(value / sum(value), accuracy = 0.1, trim = FALSE))\nuk_census_2021_religion_merged &lt;- rbind(uk_census_2021_religion_totals, uk_census_2021_religion_wmids)\nggplot(uk_census_2021_religion_merged, aes(fill=dataset, x=key, y=perc)) + geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat =\"identity\")\n\n\n\n\nNow you can see a very rough comparison, which sets bars from the W Midlands data and overall data side by side for each category. The same principles that we’ve used here can be applied to draw in more data. You could, for example, compare census data from different years, e.g. 2001 2011 and 2021. Our use of dplyr::mutate above can be repeated to add an infinite number of further series’ which can be plotted in bar groups.\nWe’ll draw this data into comparison with later sets in the next chapter. But the one glaring issue which remains for our chart is that it’s lacking in really any aesthetic refinements. This is where ggplot really shines as a tool as you can add all sorts of things.\nThese are basically just added to our ggplot code. So, for example, let’s say we want to improve the colours used for our bars. You can specify the formatting for the fill on the scale using scale_fill_brewer. This uses a particular tool (and a personal favourite of mine) called colorbrewer. Part of my appreciation of this tool is that you can pick colours which are not just visually pleasing, and produce useful contrast / complementary schemes, but you can also work proactively to accommodate colourblindness. Working with colour schemes which can be divergent in a visually obvious way will be even more important when we work on geospatial data and maps in a later chapter.\n\nggplot(uk_census_2021_religion_merged, aes(fill=dataset, x=key, y=perc)) + geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat =\"identity\") + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\nWe might also want to add a border to our bars to make them more visually striking (notice the addition of color to the geom_bar below. I’ve also added reorder() to the x value to sort descending from the largest to smallest.\nYou can find more information about reordering ggplots on the R Graph gallery.\n\nuk_census_2021_religion_merged$dataset &lt;- factor(uk_census_2021_religion_merged$dataset, levels = c('wmids', 'totals'))\nggplot(uk_census_2021_religion_merged, aes(fill=fct_reorder(dataset, value), x=reorder(key,-value),value, y=perc)) + geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat =\"identity\", colour = \"black\") + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can fine tune a few other visual features here as well, like adding a title with ggtitle and a them with some prettier fonts with theme_ipsum() (which requires the hrbrthemes() library). We can also remove the x and y axis labels (not the data labels, which are rather important).\n\nggplot(uk_census_2021_religion_merged, aes(fill=fct_reorder(dataset, value), x=reorder(key,-value),value, y=perc)) + geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat =\"identity\", colour = \"black\") + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") + ggtitle(\"Religious Affiliation in the UK: 2021\") + xlab(\"\") + ylab(\"\")"

However, as you will see in the next chapter, large data sets from the same year which asked a fairly similar question yield different results. Part of this could be attributed to the amount of non-respose to this specific question which, in the 2021 census is between 5-6% across many demographics. It’s possible (though perhaps unlikely) that all those non-responses were Sikh respondents who felt uncomfortable identifying themselves on such a survey. If even half of the non-responses were of this nature, this would dramatically shift the results especially in comparison to other minority groups. So there is some work for us to do here in representing non-response as a category on the census. But it’s equally possible that someone might feel uncertain when answering, but nonetheless land on a particular decision marking “Christian” when they wondered if they should instead tick “no religion. Some surveys attempt to capture uncertainty in this way, asking respondents to mark how confident they are about their answers, but the census hasn’t capture this so we simply don’t know. If a large portion of respondents in the”Christian” category were hovering between this and another response, again, they might shift their answers when responding on a different day, perhaps having just had a conversation with a friend which shifted their thinking. Even the inertia of survey design can have an effect on this, so responding to other questions in a particular way, thinking about ethnic identity, for example, can prime a person to think about their religious identity in a different or more focussed way, altering their response to the question. For this reason, some survey instruments randomise the order of questions. This hasn’t been done on the census (which would have been quite hard work given that most of the instruments were printed hard copies!), so again, we can’t really be sure if those answers given are stable. Finally, researchers have also found that when people are asked to mark their religious affiliation, sometimes they can prefer to mark more than one answer. A person might consider themselves to be “Muslim” but also “Spiritual but not religious” preferring the combination of those identities. It is also the case that respondents can identify with more unexpected hybrid religious identities, such as “Christian” and “Hindu”. The census only allows respondents to tick a single box for the religion category. It is worth noting that, in contrast, the responses for ethnicity allow for combinations. Given that this is the case, it’s impossible to know which way a person went at the fork in the road as they were forced to choose just one half of this kind of hybrid identity. Finally, it is interesting to wonder exactly what it means for a person when they tick a box like this. Is it because they attend synagogue on a weekly basis? Some persons would consider weekly attendance at workship a prerequisite for membership in a group, but others would not. Indeed we can infer from surveys and research which aims to track rates of participation in weekly worship that many people who tick boxes for particular religious identities on the census have never attended a worship service at all.\nWhat does this mean for our results? Are they completely unreliable and invalid? I don’t think this is the case or that taking a clear-eyed look at the force and stability of our underlying data should be cause for despair. Instead, the most appropriate response is humility. Someone has made a statement which is recorded in the census, of this we can be sure. They felt it to be an accurate response on some level based on the information they had at the time. And with regard to the census, it is a massive, almost completely population level, sample so there is additional validity there. The easiest way to represent all this reality in the form of speaking truthfully about our data is to acknowledge that however valid it may seem, it is nonetheless a snapshot. For this reason, I would always advise that the best title for a chart is one which specifies the data set. We should also probably do something different with those non-responses:\n\nggplot(uk_census_2021_religion_merged, aes(fill=fct_reorder(dataset, value), x=reorder(key,-value),value, y=perc)) + geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat =\"identity\", colour = \"black\") + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") + ggtitle(\"Religious Affiliation in the 2021 Census of England and Wales\") + xlab(\"\") + ylab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\nChange orientation of X axis labels + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\nRelabel fields Simplify y-axis labels Add percentage text to bars (or maybe save for next chapter?)"

    "text": "2.6 Multifactor Visualisation\nOne element of R data analysis that can get really interesting is working with multiple variables. Above we’ve looked at the breakdown of religious affiliation across the whole of England and Wales (Scotland operates an independent census), and by placing this data alongside a specific region, we’ve already made a basic entry into working with multiple variables but this can get much more interesting. Adding an additional quantative variable (also known as bivariate data) into the mix, however can also generate a lot more information and we have to think about visualising it in different ways which can still communicate with visual clarity in spite of the additional visual noise which is inevitable with enhanced complexity.

This uses a different R Library (I use haven for this). The upside is that in some cases where you have survey data with both a code and a value like “1” is eqivalent to “very much agree” this will preserve both in the R dataframe that is created. Now that you’ve loaded in data, you have a new R dataframe called “climate_experience_data” with a lot of columns with just under 1000 survey responses.\nOne of the challenges we faced when running this study is how to gather responsible data from surveys regarding religious identity. We’ll dive into this in depth as we do analysis and look at some of the agreements and conflicts in terms of respondent attribution. Just to set the stage, we used the following kinds of question to ask about religion and spirituality:\nThis is one way of measuring religion, that is, to ask a person if they consider themselves formally affiliated with a particular group. This kind of question has some (serious) limitations, but we’ll get to that in a moment.\nWe also asked respondents (Q57): “Regardless of whether you belong to a particular religion, how religious would you say you are?” and then provided a slider from 0 (not religious at all) to 10 (very religious).\nWe included some classic indicators about how often respondents go to worship (Q58): Apart from weddings, funerals and other special occasions, how often do you attend religious services? and (Q59): “Q59 Apart from when you are at religious services, how often do you pray?”\nEach of these measures a particular kind of dimension, and it is interesting to note that sometimes there are stronger correlations between how often a person attends worship services (weekly versus once a year) and a particular view, than there is between their affiliation (if they are Christian or Pagan). We’ll do some exploratory work shortly to see how this is the case in our sample. We also included a series of questions about spirituality in Q52 and used a nature relatedness scale Q51.\nYou’ll find that many surveys will only use one of these forms of question and ignore the rest. I think this is a really bad idea as religious belonging, identity, and spirituality are far too complex to work off a single form of response. We can also test out how these different attributions relate to other demographic features, like interest in politics, economic attainment, etc.\nLet’s dive into the data and see how this all works out. We’ll start with the question 56 data, around religious affiliation:\nreligious_affiliation &lt;- as_tibble(as_factor(climate_experience_data$Q56))\nnames(religious_affiliation) &lt;- c(\"response\")\nreligious_affiliation &lt;- filter(religious_affiliation, !is.na(response))\nThere are few things we need to do here to get the data into initial proper shape. This might be called “cleaning” the data:\nIf we pause at this point to view the data, you’ll see it’s basically just a long list of survey responses. What we need is a count of each unique response (or factor). This will take a few more steps:\nreligious_affiliation_sums &lt;- religious_affiliation %&gt;%  \n1  dplyr::count(response, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n2  dplyr::mutate(response = forcats::fct_rev(forcats::fct_inorder(response)))\nreligious_affiliation_sums &lt;- religious_affiliation_sums %&gt;% \n3  dplyr::mutate(perc = scales::percent(n / sum(n), accuracy = .1, trim = FALSE))\n\n\n1\n\nFirst we generate new a dataframe with sums per category and\n\n2\n\n…sort in descending order\n\n3\n\nThen we add new column with percentages based on the sums you’ve just generated\nThat should give us a tidy table of results, which you can see if you view the contents of our new religious_affiliation_sums dataframe:\nhead(religious_affiliation_sums)\n\n# A tibble: 6 x 3\n  response                        n perc   \n  &lt;fct&gt;                       &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n1 Christian                     342 \"33.9%\"\n2 Muslim                        271 \"26.9%\"\n3 No religion                   108 \"10.7%\"\n4 Hindu                          72 \" 7.1%\"\n5 Atheist                        54 \" 5.4%\"\n6 Spiritual but not religious    38 \" 3.8%\"\n# make plot\nggplot(religious_affiliation_sums, aes(x = n, y = response)) +\n  geom_col(colour = \"white\") + \n  ## add percentage labels\n  geom_text(aes(label = perc),\n            ## make labels left-aligned and white\n            hjust = 1, nudge_x = -.5, colour = \"white\", size=3)\nAdd colours Use mutate to put “prefer not to say” at the bottom #
